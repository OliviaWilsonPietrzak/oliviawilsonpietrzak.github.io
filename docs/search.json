    "text": "I am an aspiring social scientist currently completing my master’s degree in Social Data Analytics and Research. My research interests are varied, but my most recent work has centered on the intersection of community development, housing, transportation, and economic justice. I hope to center future research on prescriptive solutions promoting socioeconomic equity.\nResearch topics that interest me include infrastructure, education, and public policy.\nI graduated with a B.A. in Economics from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2022, and am currently employed as a data analyst in an institutional research role at Dallas College.\nThis is my first class using Quarto and Github. Hopefully the rest of the semester is able to go more smoothly than the first few weeks."

    "text": "Trying to get this project to work has been very frustrating. Several attempts to begin a new project didn’t work, as an index file wasn’t generated.\n\nTo the best of my understanding, an index file is necessary to create a website using Quarto, as it acts as the homepage – without it, you can have all of the pages you want, but it won’t “catch” when you go to publish the pages on Github. Does this sound correct?\nI kept trying to create a new project by clicking in the right corner and selecting “New Project”, however this method didn’t provide me an index. However, when I selected File –&gt; New Project… the index file appeared.\nWhy?\n\n\n\nBad Method of Creating a New Project\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Method of Creating a New Project\n\n\nI wasn’t quite sure about the purpose of the index.qmb file vs. the _quarto.yaml file. The way I am thinking about it now…index just displays the text of the home page. While there isn’t anything too special happening with the page, it is necessary for the site to render. The _quarto file controls the visuals of the site – the navigation, formatting, pages displayed, etc. So the _quarto file tells the index file (and all of the other files that make up the site) how to look. Is this right?\nIf my thoughts above are true, then to update my website, I will need to create a new .qmd for each additional page I want to add (example Homework_3.qmd) and save it to the oliviawilsonpietrzak.github.io folder. I would render the .qmd so that I have an HTML version of the file, and then I would add the .qmd to the _quarto.yaml file for the site, formatting like this:\n\n\n\n_quarto.yaml Pages\n\n\n\nThis is true, I tested it with this Troubleshooting page. So for a new page to display, create the page, render and save it, add to .yaml, then render the site to ensure it is working correctly.\nI’m at the point where I can render the site locally to make sure it’s functioning correctly, but how to get it into Github?"

    "text": "Step 1: Setting Up.\nI was able to successfully download the QSF file from Dr. Ho’s website, then load the questionnaire into Qualtrics.\nStep 2: Analyze the survey.\n\nHow is the survey structured?\nThe survey begins with a disclosure statement. The survey then proceeds through a variety of questions (matrix, multiple choice, drop down selections), before a conclusion page thanking the participant.\nWhat is the questionnaire composed of?\nThe first question is a matrix question with 5 point Likert scale.\nThe next few questions are a combination of multiple choice questions (ranging from binary to up to 5 options) and drop down answers.\nHow are the questions ordered?\nThe questions escalate in sensitivity, going from broad questions regarding personal media and purchasing preferences to questions about an individual’s personal identity and socioeconomic status.\nConsider importing additional libraries (demographics and zip code).\nI was able to add in the additional libraries. The demographics was interesting in particular – there wasn’t an “all-inclusive” option – an option for Hispanic/Latino was not present in the larger list of racial backgrounds. I ended up adding in a question before the race group selection that allowed an individual to select whether or not they were Hispanic/Latino.\nFormatting.\nI was able to change the appearance to the UTD Theme, as well as adding in the Skip Logic to question 4. I tried to “chunk” the questions together to save the participant from having to scroll too much, but while keeping similar questions together. I also formatted the matrix to be mobile-friendly.\nTo improve respondents’ experience, I would try to reduce the number of questions – some feel a little redundant."
